    "An interesting thing happened in trying a few models out. While `RandomForestClassifier` is incredibly powerful, and very often produces the most accurate predictions among all classifiers, for this particular data a single `DecisionTreeClassifer` does better. Viewers might want to think about why this turns out to be true and/or experiment with hyperparameters to find a more definite explanation; other classifiers might perform better still also, of course.\n",

You can search the space in a nice high level API using [sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html), but it often suffices to use a basic Python loop like:\n",
