This repository is for use with the Pearson Publishing live webinar "Beginning Machine Learning with `scikit-learn`."  Versions of this material are used by other training provided by David Mertz and [KDM Training](http://kdm.training).

If you have attended one of the webinars using this material, I encourage you to complete the survey on it at: [Machine Learning with scikit-learn survey](https://goo.gl/pghpzD).  As folks fill this out, we will fold back the updated answers into the dataset used in the lessons themselves.

Before attending this course, please configure the environments you will need.  Within the repository, find the file `requirements.txt` to install software using `pip`, or the file `environment.yml` to install software using `conda`.  I.e.:

```bash
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
$ conda activate Pearson-ML
(Pearson-ML) $ jupyter notebook Outline.ipynb
```

Or

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ juypter notebook Outline.ipynb
```
